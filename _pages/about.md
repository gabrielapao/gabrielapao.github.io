I'm Research Assistant at the Research Center of Universidad del Pacífico (CIUP, Spanish acronym) in Lima, Peru. I got my bachelor degree in economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Perú (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú, PUCP). My main fields of interest are development, poverty and Data Science. I have conducted laboratory experiments at the Behavioral and Experimental Economics Laboratory (GECE) ant PUCP, and field experiments in Peru with Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA).
