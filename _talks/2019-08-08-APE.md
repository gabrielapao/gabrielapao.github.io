The working paper presented was "Do informal workers of small firms self-insurance forretirement?". There, we explore how individuals working in small firms in Peru decide to plan and save for retirement in different options. We collected surveys about expectations, planning and saving actions the individuals have taken for retirement. We found that individuals do have a retirement options portafolio where having an own business is the preferred option.
