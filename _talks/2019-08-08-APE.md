The working paper presented was "Do informal workers of small firms self-insurance forretirement?". There, we explore how individuals working in small firms in Peru decide to plan and save for retirement in different options. We use a novel and unique data from a survey applied in Lima Metropolitan area in 2018, which contains information about expectations, planning and saving actions the individuals have taken for retirement. We found that individuals do have a retirement options portafolio where having an own business is the preferred option.
